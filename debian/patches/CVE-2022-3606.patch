Subject: [PATCH] libbpf: Fix null-pointer dereference in
 find_prog_by_sec_insn()

When there are no program sections, obj->programs is left unallocated,
and find_prog_by_sec_insn()'s search lands on &obj->programs[0] == NULL,
and will cause null-pointer dereference in the following access to
prog->sec_idx.

Guard the search with obj->nr_programs similar to what's being done in
__bpf_program__iter() to prevent null-pointer access from happening.

Fixes: db2b8b06423c ("libbpf: Support CO-RE relocations for multi-prog sections")
